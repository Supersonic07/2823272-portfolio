                <p>
                      I am a 3rd year computer science student at wits. I enjoy learning and understanding code mainly focusing on the development of it. I prefer to often challenge myself in order to find out my capabilities and always look for what I can improve upon. I am a driven individual and enjoy taking in new information. Aside from academics I have verystong interests in art and music which I find both are very calming and very productive.

          <h3>Latest Project</h3>
          <p>
                I am going to create a point of sales service that can be broadly used across many different types and kinds of business that has the capabilities of allowing only certain services for staff and extra services for managers. It is a tough challenge but if done correctly can be utilised really well.
